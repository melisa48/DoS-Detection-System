# DoS Detection System
This project implements a machine learning-based Denial of Service (DoS) detection system. It uses simulated network traffic data to train a Random Forest classifier that can identify potential DoS attacks.

## Features
- Generates realistic network traffic data, including both normal traffic and DoS attacks
- Extracts relevant features from network traffic for DoS detection
- Implements a Random Forest classifier with hyperparameter tuning
- Provides detailed model evaluation metrics
- Visualizes results through confusion matrix and feature importance plots
- Includes a function for simulated real-time DoS detection

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required packages using:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


## Usage
To run the DoS detection system:
1. Ensure all required packages are installed
2. Run the script:
- `python dos_detection.py`


The script will:
1. Generate and preprocess simulated network traffic data
2. Train a Random Forest model with hyperparameter tuning
3. Display model performance metrics
4. Show a confusion matrix and feature importance plot
5. Perform a simulated real-time detection on a sample of the data

## File Structure
- `dos_detection.py`: Main script containing all the code for the DoS detection system

## Key Components
1. `generate_sample_data()`: Creates simulated network traffic data
2. `extract_features()`: Processes raw data and extracts relevant features
3. `train_model()`: Trains the Random Forest model, performs hyperparameter tuning, and evaluates the model
4. `detect_dos()`: Simulates real-time DoS detection on new traffic data

## Output
The script outputs:
1. Best hyperparameters found during model tuning
2. Model accuracy and a detailed classification report
3. A confusion matrix plot
4. A feature importance plot
5. Result of the simulated real-time detection

## Future Improvements
- Implement real-time data ingestion from actual network traffic
- Add more sophisticated features or try different machine learning algorithms
- Create a web interface for real-time monitoring and alerts
- Implement periodic model updates with new data
